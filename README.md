<!-- UPDATES FOR AUTH USERS: -->

1. Added method in profile controller
2. Built second app called Auth App for authenticated users to be routed to   the main components of the app
3. Added instance of profile to proflies/index.html 

Authenticated users can now sign up and be redirected to create a profile from sign up page.


Unprotected Index:

## No external API used so fetch call is not needed. Songs are coming from the database that we seeded in Rails.

Database is passed through using props. Props were defined in the constructor and dot notation is used to access specific values in the object.
